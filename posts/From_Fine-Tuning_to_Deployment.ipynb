    "Imagine unlocking the full potential of large language models (LLMs) right on your local machine, without relying on costly cloud services. This is where Ollama shines by allowing users to harness the power of LLMs on their machines. While Ollama offers a range of ready-to-use models, there are times when a custom model is necessary, whether it's fine-tuned on specific data or designed for a particular task. Efficiently deploying these custom models on local hardware often requires optimization techniques like quantization.\n",

    "## Ollama\n",
    "Ollama is an open-source platform that empowers users to run large language models (LLMs) locally, bypassing the need for cloud-based services. Designed with accessibility in mind, Ollama simplifies the installation and management of a wide range of pre-trained LLMs and embedding models, enabling easy deployment without requiring extensive technical expertise. The platform provides a local API for seamless application integration and supports frameworks like LangChain. Recently tool-calling functionality has been introduced. This feature allows models to interact with external tools - like APIs, web browsers, and code interpreters - enabling them to perform complex tasks and interact with the outside world more effectively. Thanks to a large open-source community, Ollama continues evolving its capabilities, making it a robust, cost-effective solution for local AI deployment."

    "## Quantization in Large Language Models\n",
    "**Quantization** is a crucial technique in machine learning that involves reducing the precision of a model's weights and activations, without significantly impacting the model's performance. Traditionally, these models operate using 32-bit floating point (FP32) formats, but quantization allows for the conversion of these weights to lower precision formats such as 16-bit (FP16), 8-bit (INT8), 4-bit, or even 2-bit. The primary goals of quantization are to reduce the model's memory footprint and computational demands, thereby making it possible to deploy the model on resource-constrained hardware. There are two types of quantization techniques: post-training quantization and quantization-aware training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Quantization\n",
    "**• Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)**: PTQ is a straightforward technique in which the model is quantized after it has been fully trained. This method is quick to implement and does not require retraining the model, making it ideal for scenarios where time or resources are limited. However, it may result in a slight decrease in accuracy since the model was not trained with quantization in mind.\n",
    "**• Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)**: QAT integrates quantization into the training process, allowing the model to learn to compensate for the reduced precision. This approach generally results in better performance compared to PTQ, as the model adapts to the quantized environment during training. However, QAT requires more computational resources during training and is more complex to implement."

    "**• K:** Denotes the use of k-means clustering in the quantization process. K-means clustering is a technique used to group similar weights, reducing the variation between them and allowing for more efficient quantization with minimal loss of accuracy.\n",

    "## Quantization Methods Explained\n",
    "Here's a closer look at the different quantization methods supported by llama.cpp and Ollama, following the Q#_K_M naming convention:\n",
    "<br><br>`Q2_K`: This method uses 2-bit quantization, offering the most significant size reduction but with a considerable loss in accuracy. It's mainly used in highly constrained environments where memory and processing power are extremely limited.\n",
    "<br><br>`Q3_K_S`: A 3-bit quantization method using k-means clustering, optimized for small models. This method provides significant memory savings and is used when accuracy can be somewhat compromised.\n",
    "<br><br>`Q3_K_M`: Similar to Q3_K_S but optimized for medium-sized models. This method offers a balanced trade-off between memory usage and accuracy.\n",
    "<br><br>`Q3_K_L`: This method is tailored for larger models, using 3-bit quantization with k-means clustering to reduce size while maintaining as much accuracy as possible.\n",
    "<br><br>`Q4_0`: A standard 4-bit quantization method that does not use k-means clustering. This is the default method, offering a good balance between size reduction and maintaining model accuracy. It's suitable for general use cases where memory is limited but accuracy is still important.\n",
    "<br><br>`Q4_1`: Similar to Q4_0 but with slight variations in how quantization is applied, potentially offering slightly better accuracy at the cost of a small increase in resource usage.\n",
    "<br><br>`Q4_K_S`: A variation of 4-bit quantization optimized for smaller models. It reduces the model size significantly while preserving reasonable accuracy.\n",
    "<br><br>`Q4_K_M`: This method applies 4-bit quantization with k-means clustering to medium-sized models, offering an excellent balance between size and accuracy. It's one of the most recommended methods for general use.\n",
    "<br><br>`Q5_0`: Uses 5-bit quantization, which offers higher precision than 4-bit methods, resulting in better accuracy. This method is a good choice when you have slightly more memory available and need to maintain higher accuracy.\n",
    "<br><br>`Q5_1`: A refinement of Q5_0, providing even greater accuracy by applying more sophisticated quantization techniques, though at the cost of increased resource requirements.\n",
    "<br><br>`Q5_K_S`: This method uses 5-bit quantization with k-means clustering, optimized for smaller models, providing higher accuracy than 4-bit methods with only a slight increase in resource use.\n",
    "<br><br>`Q5_K_M`: An advanced 5-bit quantization technique optimized for medium-sized models, providing high accuracy with reasonable memory efficiency. This method is often recommended for scenarios where accuracy is critical but resources are still somewhat limited.\n",
    "<br><br>`Q6_K`: This method uses 6-bit quantization, providing a middle ground between 4-bit and 8-bit methods. It's suitable when you need more accuracy than what 4-bit offers but can't afford the higher resource demands of 8-bit quantization.\n",
    "<br><br>`Q8_0`: Uses 8-bit quantization, which is nearly as accurate as the original float16 model. This method is best for scenarios where you need to preserve as much accuracy as possible while still reducing the model size.\n",
    "<br><br>In our example we choose to quantize our model to 4-bit, using the Q4_K_M method."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This article has walked you through the process of quantizing a custom model, integrating it with Ollama, and testing it locally. By leveraging the llama.cpp framework we quantized our custom model in the Q4_K_M format and pushed it to Hugging Face Hub. We then discussed how to create the corresponding Modelfile and how to integrate our model into the Ollama framework.\n",
    "<br><br>Quantization, offers significant benefits, including reduced memory footprint, faster inference times, and lower power consumption. These advantages make it feasible to deploy sophisticated AI models across a variety of hardware configurations, from high-performance servers to low-power edge devices, broadening the scope of where and how AI can be applied. I hope you enjoyed reading this article and learned something new.\n",
    "You can find the quantized model from this example on Huggingface."
