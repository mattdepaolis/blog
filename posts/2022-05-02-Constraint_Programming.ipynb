    "\n",
    "It is an invaluable tool for data scientists to solve a huge variety of problems, such as scheduling, timetabling, sequencing, etc. In this article, we'll see how to use CP in two different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Satisfiability**: the goal is to find one or multiple feasible solutions (*i.e.*, solutions that respect our constraints) by narrowing down a large set of potential solutions;\n",
    "2. **Optimization**: the goal is to find the best feasible solution according to an objective function, just like Linear Programming (LP).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use CP-SAT from [Google OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization), an excellent free and open source CP solver. Note that it is **different** from MPSolver, which is dedicated to Linear and Mixed Integer Programming. The difference between CP and LP is quite confusing, we'll touch on this topic at the end of the article.\n",

    "We found **121 solutions** with a capacity of 19. But this number quickly increases: with a capacity of 1000, there are **8,080,104** possible solutions! And yet, CP-SAT finds the optimal solution in less than a second. How is it possible?\n",

    "CP solvers do not brute force the problem with an exhaustive search, but combine heuristics and combinatorial search instead. More specifically, the three most popular techniques for constraint satisfaction problems are [**backtracking**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking), [**constraint propagation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_consistency), and [**local search**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_search_(optimization)).\n",

    "As you can see, the syntax is quite similar but it's not the same: model/solver vs. solver, `NewIntVar` instead of `IntVar`, etc. There's a bit of translation to do, but it's easily manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two techniques are **incredibly close to each other**: they both handle variables with constraints and perform optimization using math and heuristics. However, CP is limited to discrete parameters, while LP handles continuous ones. On the other hand, you can implement specialized constraints like [\"all different\"](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/12.9.0?topic=variables-all-different-constraint) in CP, but not in LP. Here is a summary of the main differences between these two technologies:\n",

    "* We saw **two applications** of CP with satisfiability and optimization;\n",
