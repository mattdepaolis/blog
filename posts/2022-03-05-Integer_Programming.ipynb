    "\n",
    "Let's talk about the elephant in the room. Why not use **machine learning** (in a broad sense) instead of linear programming? It's not like this problem cannot be solved with a genetic algorithm for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical optimization is often neglected in favor of machine learning techniques, but both have their merits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linear programming can produce an **optimal solution** in an undetermined amount of time (it can take years), while machine learning can approximate complex functions in no time.\n",
    "* There is **no training** in LP, but an expert is required to build a mathematical model. Machine learning needs data, but the models can be used as black boxes to solve a problem.\n",
    "* As a rule of thumb, problems that **do not have a particular time constraint** and/or are not extremely complex can be advantageously solved with linear programming.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we dived deeper into our understanding of mathematical optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We talked about solvers and types of optimization problems: **LP, MIP, NLP**;\n",
    "* We modeled and solved an extremely common optimization problem in an optimal way and **generalized our model** through a function;\n",
    "* We reframed this problem and **merged two sets of constraints** to obtain the best army composition for the lowest price;\n",
    "* We compared the **pros and cons** of linear programming and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **a lot more problems** where optimization can be applied. For instance, how to create school timetables that satisfy everybody's requirements? How to deliver 1,000 different orders in a minimum amount of time? Where to create a new metro line to maximize its usefulness?\n",
    "\n",
    "In future articles, we'll talk about new types of applications for these techniques, including satisfiability and nonlinear problems.\n",
